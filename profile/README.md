# About

With Nutrieasy, we aim to create a super app that can help people understand the nutritional needs of the fruits or vegetables they eat. The app offers guidance on health, especially nutritional details in food consumption. The data from Nutrieasy helps users know the nutritional details of their regular consumption better and is designed for everyone who needs help tracking their food consumption, with features such as Fruit and Vegetable Nutrition Detection and Daily nutrition tracker to track the user's intake of key nutrients every day based on user data. By providing these features to the public, Nutrieasy hopes to contribute to providing guidance on nutritional needs to maintain health.
